1. Fa (farsi) version of the website needs the local fonts to be loaded 
alongside the DOM files.

2. Two different versions should exist at the same directory *default* in order
for the switch language button to work properly when switching between them.

3. This is an ever evolving project of mine so I appreciate correction and 
suggestions on the code :D
